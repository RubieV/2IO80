<h1>Electives</h1>
<p>
    45 ECTS are (almost) entirely free to choose during the <a href="?id=3">bachelor college</a> program. There are
    certain restrictions to
    keep the electives coherent and provide the student with valuable additional information. To do this, there are
    elective-packages that make it easy for the student to choose a consistent set of electives. It is up to you to
    decide how to fill this part of your study program:
</p>
<p>
    Within your own discipline, exploring your <a href="?id=6">major</a> in greater depth.<br />
    Within a different discipline, expanding your horizons by combining different fields.<br />
    Opting for a combination within one of the TU/e research areas: Energy, Health and Smart Mobility.
