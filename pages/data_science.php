<h1>Data Science</h1>
<p>
    You are interested in computers and enjoy analytical thinking. You are not afraid of mathematics and see a challenge
    in large bulks of data and to top it all up, you have just opened the website of the exact bachelor that will
    fulfill all these demands: Data Science.

<p>
    In this three year bachelor, students will master the art of analysing data and putting this into an understandable
    model or presentation. To do this, skills in acquiring and building datasets, creating visualisations and
    mathematical models and communicating the results will be honed. These competences will make up the largest part of
    the bachelor and will be referred to as the <a href="?id=6">major</a>. The bachelor will be taught in English.

<p>
    Data Science is part of the <a href="?id=3">bachelor college</a> and thereby offers students a broad section of
    electives in a flexible schedule, together with <a href="?id=16">base courses</a> that all engineers need. The
    students will also follow the so-called <a href="?id=5">USE courses</a> that put the skills and information gathered
    in the major in a broader, societal context.
